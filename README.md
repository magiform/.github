# Magitools

Magitools are tools (weird, right) created to solve specific problems that I ([Matteo](https://matteogassend.com)) had.

The projects currently in development are:
- magiedit: a markdown article editor that allows to publish simultaneously to multiple platforms (and multiple accounts on those platforms)
- magiconvert: upload an image, convert it, resize, generate a blurhash string (optional)
- magiform: forms as a service, kind of. Create an endpoint for your form and add integrations to be triggered when a form is submitted

More to come, but maybe I (we) should get to a good point on those described above
